Objective Topology Suite (OTS) is an Objective-C adaptation of [Java Topology Suite (JTS)](http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html) and [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) library that primarily targeted for iPhone platform, but should work as well for Mac OSX. This library is currently under development, incomplete, and not properly tested, thus should not be considered ready for production systems.

This project was moved from the original repository at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/objective-topology-suite/).

Features implemented so far:

* All geometries with basic operations, such as: intersects, contains, within, etc.
* Algorithms related to intersections.
* Geometry graph.
* STRTree.
